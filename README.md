# Linear-programming-solver
A Python-based **Linear Programming Solver** that calculates optimal solutions using the **extreme points method**. This project allows users to input a target function and constraints interactively, then computes:

- **Optimal extreme points**  
- **Recession directions**  
- **Finite optimal solutions**  

It is built with **NumPy** for efficient numerical operations and is designed to be a simple, educational, and flexible solver for small- to medium-scale linear programming problems.
